# Full Organized Documentation
For a more organized and overall better looking docs, [this is the page for the docs](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/).
More features coming soon btw!
# Goals
- Implement crypto mode (encrypts data and decrypts it too, so if someone has access to the database, they will not understand the content).
- On warning messages, include the line for the error.
- MDFS (Multi Database File System, explained on the github repo's v2.0.0 project)

If you have suggestions, let me know on the support server (link on [docs](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/))!

# Updates
**v1.4.0** - there is now [**raw** functions](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/methods#.raw-or-raw-functions-and-parameters), [set the entire database function](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/methods#.setall-data) for an object and [keys function](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/methods#.keys).
