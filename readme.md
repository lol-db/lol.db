# Full Organized Documentation
For a more organized and overall better looking docs, [this is the page for the docs](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/).
More features coming soon btw!
# Goals
- Implement crypto mode (encrypts data and decrypts it too, so if someone has access to the database, they will not understand the content).
- Make lol.db multi-language (python, and etc.)
- On warning messages, include the line for the error.

If you have suggestions, let me know on the support server (link on [docs](https://widev.gitbook.io/lol.db/))!
